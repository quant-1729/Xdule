The application shows the daily timetable of the students in a simple, easy and efficient way and flush their morning irritation. 
I mainly used Android Studio for the creation of the application.

Table of Contents-
1) The Inatial making 

In it I created 4 activity pages. The first one is main activity page which take the input fromthe user as DAY and GROUPR with a 
autocomplete textview( i.e the text will auto complete) and a Check button which checks the schedule. Then Their is a Setting Activity page allows the user
to Download the pdf format of all schedule also it contain buttons for the direction of other projects. Then is the about activity which contian the info
for app.

2) The Database

It contain the in build database by creating a SQLite database class in the DB_handeler class. There are many method in this class which take the inout 
from the Mainactivity page and generate the Sql quiries using them and then implement then in the DB_handeler Class to give the user the desired output.
It is the most time consuming and relativy difficult part than most of the Project. I lerned many things about databases, firewalls, sql, sqlite, their
application and how to implement them in any application.

The morning irritation of vewing  a complex and hectic timetable that every student of my batch feels motivated me to make an application which will
simplyfy the complex time table into a three field for. It will help students to see the daily schedule very easily and efficiently.
